Not one more less	Maria Fernanda de Alba	Mexico is a machinist country, where violence is normalized common behavior. This violence lived in the country brought in 2019 the painful scenario of 3,893 femicides, which are shown in the posters. Every woman is represented by a fingerprint and every bunch of fingerprints represents the number of homicides per state, which are also located on the Mexican map according to the state position.	notonemoreless.png	https://www.behance.net/gallery/113162221/Not-One-More-Less?
v[u]oto	Gaia Panfoli	In Italy there are no adequate legislative solutions that allow an outpost citizen to vote remotely. This electoral card has 100 cells, representing the total of italian university students. Stamps fill the cells and attest the resident students who can vote from their home city. The empty cells represent students who we suppose do not have the chance to vote away from their residency.	vuoto.jpg	https://www.behance.net/gallery/113167667/vuoto
100% stolen innocence	Emily Maria Salmaso	Female genital mutilation (FGM) has affected more than 200 million girls and women alive today; their innocence was stolen forever, as the practise is irreversible. The video aims to show the data available globally by creating a contrast between the inhumanity of the practise and an activity that was always associated with innocence, purity and femininity: cross-stitch.	stoleninnocence.png	https://stoleninnocence.cargo.site/
Parresia	Elena Gibelli	Parresia (moral duty to tell the truth) represents the origin of the concept of "freedom of speech". What happens when this duty ceases to be a right? The project shows the degree of freedom of expression in 30 different countries using letters as a metaphor.  Each country is associated with a quote which will be more or less readable: the degree of freedom of speech is translated into the number of letters that each country has available to compose the sentence.	parresia.jpg	https://elegib.github.io/parresia/
Blue Mirror: How the EU sees itself	Johannes Longardt	The reputation of the EU varies a lot across its member countries. The website shows data from the Eurobarometer, a poll on the opinion about the EU, from the last 10 years. Cracks in the screen show the gravity of the result: The more cracks there are, the worse an outcome is compared to the others.	bluemirror.png	https://jlongardt.github.io/blue-mirror/
Dance Of Happiness	Virginia Migliorini	During the COVID year, have you ever donated to a charity? Did you feel free to choose what to do with your life? These are two of many questions that European citizens were asked to answer for a poll measuring countries’ happiness. Two dancing performances represent the two rankings about generosity of European people and their freedom to make life choices. The more dancer movements are open and the room is lit, the more the country has been happy.	dancehappiness.png	https://danceofhappiness.cargo.site/
Feeling Grey	Elisa Finesso	Feeling Grey is a short video that wants to make people think about the importance of invisible diseases and the huge impact they can have in people's lives. Often these conditions are not visible from the outside but a "touch of ink" is enough to make everything clear. Anxiety exists, panic attacks exist and many people suffer from them. Let's not remain indifferent.	feelinggrey.png	https://vimeo.com/510015713
The poor little souls	Dang Trung Nguyen	While suicidal behaviors have been well-studied in high-income countries, there is a smaller evidence base from low- and middle-income countries. This is attributed to the lack of surveillance systems to monitor adolescent health and health behaviors. This project aims to describe the prevalence of suicidal behaviors, depression, and factors associated among high school students in Hanoi, Vietnam.	thepoorlittlesouls.png	https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YDhj_PRsBk9X_Mt0Q2PlVfEtM73-pLuw?usp=sharing
SELLFISH	Giulia Baraldi	Fish consumption in Italy has increased significantly in recent years, leading to the spread of intensive farming. Here fish live huddled together and in poor conditions before arriving on supermarket shelves and then on our tables. The project aims to show the correlation between the annual per capita fish consumption and the growth of fish purchased from intensive farms during years through the most representative means of eating: the plate.	sellfish.png	https://giuliabaraldi.com/SellFish
Gender discount	Sofia Peracchi	Gender discount aims to shed a light on the gender pay gap that still occurs in Italy. Focusing on how the perception of people’s worth is jeopardised because of the differences in their income, the gap is presented as a discount on people’s value, using Barbie©, a brand symbol of capitalism and inaccurate portrayal of reality, to show how real and impacting this disparity really is.	genderdiscount.png	https://sofia-peracchi.github.io/gender-discount/
Stay Real	Fatemeh Goodarzi	Internet and social media addictions continue to grow as our dependence on technology increases. Estimates posit that over 210 million people suffer from internet and social media addictions worldwide.	stayreal.png	NON HA INVIATO NULLA
The sitting disease	Elena Buttolo	The amount of time an average person spends sitting has risen significantly since the early part of the decade. In 2016, US adults spent about 6.5 hours a day sitting outside of work or school, much of the time due to computer and TV use. The goal of the projects is to highlight the growing habit of sitting during free time, something that can be associated with more serious health problems.	sitting-disease.png	https://vimeo.com/510403721
AstroPaper	Alessia Rodler	Since 2014, Millennials have been the most stressed generation and they are likely to say their stress has increased since 2010. In this scenario, the astrology trend continues to grow, even more every year, offering a sort of comfort in imagining a better future in this crisis of uncertainty.	astropaper.png	https://www.are.na/alessia-rodler/astropaper
In Case of Emergency 	Cecilia Gaetarelli	Nowadays through our smartphones we can immediately get in touch with anyone anywhere. Sharing has become the main action to show our presence on Social Media. The ubiquitous of smartphones enables people to share any kind of event in real time, from a photo of their cute lunch to tweets about the latest catastrophic event. Twitter becomes an unexplored field for detecting situation of emergencies. But are we able to manage all these immediate informations? 	incaseofemergency.png	https://issuu.com/ceciliagaetarelli/docs/presentation_
The Reason	Hu Tianjing	Violence against women continues to be an obstacle to achieving equality and peace, as well as to the fulfillment of women and girls’ human rights. "The Reason" try to exploring the attitudes and perceived justifications given for committing acts of violence against women."The Reason" also reveals dramatic insights into some of the attitudes and assumptions that prevent progress in the global campaign to end violence against women and girls.	thereason.png	https://hutianjing1996.wixsite.com/website
[ ] is the limit	Andrea M. Morandini	Since the dawn of civilization mankind has been fascinated by great heights, erecting tall buildings that aim to touch the sky. This infopoem’s goal is to highlight the evolution of this phenomenon across human history, from 10.000 BC up to now, by visualizing the limit to which we pushed ourselves at scraping the sky.	isthelimit.png	https://www.behance.net/gallery/113203295/-IS-THE-LIMIT
Dead List of Homeless.	Yuting Jiang	Generally speaking, the dead homeless is a group that is not concerned by the public with a steep increase of the dead homeless population. The poster visualizes the increased death data in 18 months to make the 'invisible' death visualizable. I hope to use it to arouse people's perception of the increased data. Recording their death and increasing transparency will continue their tragic ending and expect to get the public's attention and help.	deadlistofhomeless.jpg	http://yutingjiang911.weupgo.cn/
2020 advent calendar - waiting for a vaccine	Vera Salvaderi	This advent calendar explores the lockdown period that went from 3rd November to 6th December. It was a period in which time seemed to be in pause and the common feeling was of suspense and eternal waiting for the situation to come back to normality. The data viz represents through a collection of photos my family's quarantine routine.	2020adventcalendar.png	http://quarantineadventcalendar.altervista.org/
To plants	Virgilia Ramella	In the last 250 years almost 600 species of plants have gone extinct. While awareness about animals extinctions is rather widespread, almost no one could name a plant which is forever lost. Nevertheless, plant extinctions are quicker and bigger than those of other species and can lead to a cascade of deaths in other organisms that rely on them. “To plants” is a replicable memorial: an installation to bump into and interact with, to remember and rise consciousness about this phenomenon. 	toplants.png	https://www.behance.net/gallery/113221739/To-plants
Venice Sea Level 1910-2000	Yuan Liu	Through the information graphics, the audience will intuitively feel the rising water level in Venice and the current climate problems faced by mankind.	flood.jpg	https://www.flipsnack.com/79CB56EEFB5/ddd2021-infopoetry-yuan-liu.html
Mental health and COVID-19	Julia Chlastacz	This project aims to inform about the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, by showing the increase in the number of people with clinically significant level of mental distress. Clinically significant level indicates high risk of developing mental illness or other disorders. Identification of populations at increased risk for psychological distress hope to inform policies to address health inequity. 	mentalhealthandcovid19.png	http://youtu.be/yscoStnizfc
To Eat or Not to Eat?	Yunrui Zhu	Migraine is a multi-dimensional and complex disease affected by genetic and environmental factors. At the same time, as another essential factor affecting migraine, lifestyle has been neglected. From the perspective of daily food, this project shows how the diet amount affects the probability of migraine, the use of contradictory visual shows the beautiful daily food behind actually hidden risks.	toeatornottoeat.png	NON HA INVIATO NULLA
How much is art across Europe for under 26?	Beatrice Maggi	Many European museums offer free entrance to under 26; the animation showcases some of them, each identified by the most famous artworks they display. The video plays on the regular pay-per-view system, inverting it. This sort of on demand content allows those who pay to see something “premium” and exclusive. Artwise this mechanism doesn’t occur: users can experience valuable content for free. 	howmuchisartacrosseuropeforunder26.jpg	https://vimeo.com/509907733
Please don’t Bully Me	Ruting Lin	Campus bullying is an important factor that hinders the healthy growth of children. We need to understand these bullied children and take the initiative to protect their young and fragile hearts. I hope that the audience can feel the inner pain of the children suffering from campus bullying while watching this series of art painting images, so as to arouse the attention of these children.	schoolbully.png	http://lrt.roycent.cn/
Serie A and La Liga players' home country comparasion	Songwei Duan	By exploring the home country of the players in Serie A, more thoughts about human geography can be stimulated.	serieaylaliga.png	http://dsw.roycent.cn/
Is death really equal for everybody?	Sara Ferrini	The inevitability of death is a widespread fear for many humans around the world. After all, death is universal, mysterious, and immutable.  The project reflects the causes of death and their intentionally filtered perceptions and projections by the media nowadays. The media provides a near-instantaneous snapshot of individual events. These events are, in most cases, negative. The persistent large-scale normalized events never make the headlines anymore. 	isdeathreallyequalforeverybody.png	https://www.behance.net/gallery/113212181/Is-death-really-equal-for-everybody
Of machines and men	Isabella Possaghi 	The memory that survives around Kasparov vs DeepBlue matches is about the endless battle between humanity and technology for the intellect dominance in a game of pure logic. A narration that wants to highlight the inevitable difference in attitudes between machines and men in playing chess, keeping the focus on the champion, exhausted by not having an opponent in the flesh to study and to predict.	of_machines_and_men.png	https://isabellapossaghi.github.io/Ofmachinesandmen/
Broken	Song Danlin	In 2019, there are still countries with a refugee rate of nearly 40% , which means that 4 out of 10 people are refugees. Broken is a series of photographs, aimed to invoke people to think about what these data behind means. Each photograph represents each country. More broken, loose and dusty the brick wall, higher refugee rate in this country.	broken.png	https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jdM3lVjzLBDR9ImPEMvqqycpVGz4FhdJ/view?usp=sharing
feelings to be named	Priscila Yoshihara	feelings to be named is a compendium of invented words. They were not necessarily intended to be used in conversation, but to exist for their own sake. These words identify unnamed emotional states, and offer both a poetic term and a contemplative introspection. Whether or not these words are incorporated into the language, many of them seem familiar, and terrifically crafted to put in words the untouchable.	feelingstobenamed.png	https://priyoshihara.github.io/obscuresorrows/
The gift of life	Chenyun Zeng	Organ transplantation is a way to pass on life. There is a gap between the number of organ donations in Europe and the number of organ transplants waiting in 2020. This series of posters intuitively reflects the current demand for organ donation. Each poster describes the real data of an organ, and each piece of the core green puzzle is equal to the number of 100 organs.	thegiftoflife.png	https://tippi-zeng.github.io/infopoetry2021/
From information to bias	Valentina Pallacci	In Italy there is a wrong over-representation of the migration phenomenon. The wide media coverage leads to an inability of the audience to recognize the structural characteristics of the phenomenon, thus defining an overestimated perception of it. The project's aim is to reflect on the newspapers' impoverishment and how their narrative about immigration has influenced readers' perceptions.	frominformationtobias.png	https://www.are.na/valentina-pallacci/from-information-to-bias
Buy Me Air 	Buy Me Air 	Amazon has changed the way Americans shop. This year, the e-commerce giant said its annual Prime Day sale was “the biggest shopping event in Amazon history.” The introduction of one-day shipping was immediately followed by an increase in the general pollution of the planet as couriers can no longer allocate resources to ensure efficiency but to speed up delivery in order to meet these tight deadlines.	buymeair.png	https://federicopozzi.github.io/BuyMeAir/
SCREAM 'N SHOUT	Andrea Silvano	SCREAM ’N SHOUT is invitation to always be aware that very comfortable feature do not come for free. In order to be able to instantly connect to our wifi network when entering our home, our phone is constantly screaming out our information, trying to connect to our favorite networks. What if we could give voice to this processes, to understand more and more what our devices are constantly up to? 	scream-n-shout.png	https://andreasilvano.github.io/scream-n-shout/index.html
Can not sleep	Xueyue Wu	In China, staying up late is regarded as a kind of fashion lifestyle among the young people. I hope to inform people that unhealthy lifestyle is harmful to their body through the inform poem. The message on the website will provide people with inspirations to change their habits.	cannotsleep.png	https://wuxueyue1995.wixsite.com/website
The Bigger Picture	Sneha Baliga	A person’s entire life is broken down into the total time on average in years/months doing tasks in their lifetime and compared with the lifespans of animals. The metaphor focuses on the perception of time and the comparison is intended to bring perspective on how human beings perceive time compared to animals. It could also lead to reflection of our relationship with animals. Thus the name ‘The Bigger Picture’. 	the-bigger-picture.jpg	https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13osZSKFauLUgkbGcM08aebuQM7mu8pmG?usp=sharing
TUSKS	Alessandro Parca	Elephant poaching, after a few years of almost no recorded cases, resurfaced in South Africa in 2014. Since then, the numbers have continued to grow alarmingly.  TUSKS aims to tell this story visually: each illegal killing is depicted as an elephant tusk (the part of the elephant that poachers seek) falling to the ground, forming, as the years go by, a taller and taller pile with the others.	tusks.png	https://vimeo.com/510355900
The Great Music Race	Preeti Puri	Popular music is an essential cultural expression that has captured listeners' attention for ages. But is there a single defining year in music? The metaphor is a race to bestow the title of “The Greatest Decade for music of all time” and relevance is that music's quality was at its peak in the 1960s to 1970s and kept declining with each passing decade. In this race, just like in reality, what would help a decade win would be the right balance of harmony, melody, complexity and meaning. 	thegreatmusicrace.jpg	https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MB_n0jC8P15Jk7YlT_zHnUPt7LnL0_kd?usp=sharing
Chartbreakers	Tim Olbrich	It is a myth that artists sit for hours at their piano, spending nights over their notes while they wait for a sudden inspiration. This romanticized image might apply to movies, but the reality looks different. Catchy songs like “Last Christmas” are produced with the help of reoccurring patterns, rules that direct them. This infopoetry’s aim is to make some of these patterns visible.	chartbreakers.jpg	https://tolbri.github.io/spotify-infopoetry/
How about their voice?	Martina Andreotti	Due to the Italian law on citizenship, more than 1 million people are deprived not only of the right to vote, but also of full access to rights and welfare. Some proposals to change the law have been presented in the last 15 years, but they have remained unrealized. The project aims to show that the number of people who can be called “Italians without citizenship” is much higher than we think.	how-about-their-voice.png	https://vimeo.com/510166702
Gradually spoken quietly	WU Wenxuan	There are 7000 known languages globally, and such tragedies have occurred in various countries in varying degrees. This design is a set of posters that expose the number of endangered languages ​​in various countries and invoke people to think about the phenomenon of cultural disappearance behind languages' disappearance. "Maybe some people are the last letter of a language."	graduallyspokenquietly.png	https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eVRQNUIXWsxAzfsvyStwa8EwvSGdk6Dc
The Forest of Languages	Andre Barbosa Calderolli	Portuguese is the only official spoken language in Brazil, at a national level, but more than 200 tongues can be heard among its 211 million inhabitants. According to UNESCO, 191 of those are at risk of extinction. The Forest of Languages is a project about the beauty that resides in diversity, specifically in the diversity of languages, and the importance of valuing it. 	theforestoflanguages.png	https://ndrcldrll.github.io/the-forest-of-languages/
Ahogados en silencio	María Paula Vargas Triana	Silence, in its right amount is delightful, is serene. But when it crosses the line of the permissible, it’s uncomfortable and overwhelming. Colombia is nowadays, the first country where human rights defenders are killed almost every day. In the attempt of stoping their fights and claims they are killed for no clear reason and no one to blame. Confusion, silence and tears are the only thing left	ahogadosensilencio.png	https://vimeo.com/510311084
Under the Sea	Tai Yixuan	The threat of global warming and the rising sea level has led to the reduction of human living land areas with continuous land erosion and flooding.   The shellfish and coral grow on the furniture reflect the threat of sea-level rise to human habitat. When the chair is entirely corroded by seawater, full of shellfish, unable to sit down or use, it means that the city is no longer habitable, and people can only choose to immigrate.  These advertising posters aim to make people realize that the sea level rising is threatening everyone's safety, and it's closely related to us. We should pay attention to the situation of global warming and take measures to curb it. Otherwise, we will lose our living place.  	underthesea.jpg	https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BQ8HLdL-RlPapdnI-MoL6Go3c21wgtEa?usp=sharing
DIE  YOUNG	Wang Pengbo	Suicide among teenagers is becoming more and more frequent. As the tagline of ‘American Association of Suicidology’ says I strongly believe that suicide prevention is everyone’s business. We can choose to stand together in the face of a society which may often feel like a lonely and disconnected place, and we can choose to make a difference by making lives more livable for those who struggle to cope.   This project includes two data visualizations. I hope that this project can draw people's attention to the phenomenon of youth suicide.	die-young.jpg	https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BTdWrJiFsHnsg4yf3dj353-N9XYtS6ID?usp=sharing
Remote freelancing the new normal?	Bogdan Novakovic	Millions of permanent, full-time jobs has been eliminated this year due corona pandemic that shaked the world. Therefore, by necessity freelancing has become a means of survival for some of them. The therm remote working has become new normal all over the world, but that therm was used before in pre-Covid times  mostly by people that work in IT, Design and similar tech related industries as freelancers. Project is poster data design.	remothefreelancingthenewnormal.png	HA INVIATO FILE PDF
323 HOURS	Claudia Maria Cutrupi	Covid has had an important impact on all our habits, to the point that our only social relationships place inside our home via videocall. So I wondered: How much time did I spend on it during my session? The project aims to describe people’s perception of time: the translation of a specific amount of time in different ways, like read a book or take a trip, lead the user to reflect about the distortion of time.  	323hours.png	https://claudiacut.github.io/323-hours/
OVERCROWDED	Francesca Mauri	About 900 mln people live in slums, overpopulated and unsustainable areas. The project aims to emphasize how individual and social growth is influenced by the socio-economic background of origin. It will consider the 5 characteristics that affect the lives of slum inhabitants, and the data on population density to visualize the life’s condition inequity between developed and developing countries. 	overcrowded.png	https://overcrowded.cargo.site/
Gambling the pandemic	Alia Kaouel	The corona virus pandemic has changed many aspects of our lives. Entire populations confined to their homes are making them more available to  nline betting sites.

Heterotopion	Marija Nikolic	Inspired by  Michele Foucault’s concept of prison institutions as “Heterotopias of deviation”, Heterotopion is a picture of a fictional prison building constructed form the various movies scenes. Metaphor presents how the popular culture portrayal of the prison is the only determinant of public knowledge of these institutions. Fictional and disorted representations of criminology omnipresent in our knowledge, as a consequence, play a significant role widespread construction of fear towards criminology aparatus and its stereotypical imagery in collective mind.	heterotopion.png	https://mariaahnikolic.github.io/heterotopion/
50 years of Water Conflicts	Caterina Comini	The project’s aim is to raise awareness about water conflicts and all the disputes involving access to water resources. To display the increasing number of this kind of conflicts and the waste of water resources they cause, the video shows a timeline composed with black sand, metaphor of water scarcity, especially in the last twenty years. The video allowed me to manage the time in which the user enjoys the content, guiding him till the end.	50yearsofwaterconflicts.png	https://50yearsofwaterconflicts.cargo.site
iWalt	Marco Gabriele	How the themes covered in Disney cartoon songs have changed over the last thirty years (1989-2019). An Apple-style commercial to "travel" back and forth in time, where each theme corresponds to a color and each cover contains a percentage of the colors related to the themes covered in each song. If in the ’80 and ’90 the main themes were love and family, now we sing much more about emancipation, respect and resilience, reflecting the evolution of society in the last thirty years.	iWalt.png	https://vimeo.com/507934386
Amnesia 	Jacopo Sironi	How does human memory fade out? Our memory regression is not constant and is variable. While we forget we miss more and more details of a memory, until it deletes completely. Our memory fades out like the film of old photographs. Human memory is quantifiable and a study published on "Journal of neuroscience" demonstrates it. Data show how memories stick on our minds differently depending on topics and subjects. The goal of the project is to reflect on the fragility of memories.	amnesia.png	https://sironij.github.io/amnesia/

Railway Index	Federica Laurencio Tacoronte	According to European Union’s sustainable development plan, by 2030 the majority of medium-haul passenger transport and 70% of freight transport should be carried out by train. However, this goal seems far away for most EU countries when comparing the length of the railway line with the actual territorial extension. Through the metaphor of the ladder, this infopoetry underlines how it is necessary to invest in public and sustainable transport.	railwayindex.png	https://federicalaurencio.github.io/railway-index/
